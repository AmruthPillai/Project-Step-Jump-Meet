Introduction
-
A fun and innovative new game that puzzles you to the bone, developed using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. Developed by a group of students from Dayananda Sagar Institute, Bangalore.

How to Play?
-
* Click on any two boxes in a step to calculate the result (depending on whether it will add or subtract). This result is the next value of the resulting box.
* For each two boxes clicked, it counts as a new step, and the step counter increases by one.
* The resulting box's value will be considered as the jump count, and the jump counter will move back from Z to the number of places as per the result.
* The **objective of the game is to make both the step counter and jump counter to meet during the game**, having the conditions that *you have only 26 steps and you can't cross out of the jump counter range*.
